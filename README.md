![Udacity][logo] Project 3: Multi User Blog
====================================

# Project Overview

In this project, I was asked to build a multiuser blog where users can sign in
and post blog posts as well as 'Like' and 'Comment' on other posts made on the
blog. You can also share each post on Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus.
